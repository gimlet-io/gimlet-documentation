Welcome to this article about gitops repository structuring! If you're new to gitops, it's a modern approach to continuous delivery that uses git as the source of truth for application deployments. Gitops is becoming the de-facto deployment approach as more teams adopt cloud-native architectures and embrace devops practices.

One important aspect of gitops is the structure of the git repository used to manage your application configurations and deployment manifests. The way you structure your repository can greatly impact the efficiency and reliability of your gitops workflow.

In this article, we'll explore different approaches to structuring your gitops repository so you gain a better understanding of how to structure your gitops repository to optimize your deployment process.

Ok. On to the good stuff! 

## Monorepo
A monorepo is a single Git repository that contains all the configuration files and scripts for both infrastructure and the application.

people can use different appraoches within the monorepo strategy.

### Folder based environment separation

```
repo-name
|
├── apps
│   ├── dev
|     |-- folder1
|     |-- folder2
│   ├── prod
|     |-- folder1
|     |-- folder2
├── infrastructure
|   ├── dev
|     |-- folder1
|     |-- folder2    
|   ├── prod
|     |-- folder1
|     |-- folder2    

```
#### Pros:

* Easy collaboration and versioning across all the components.
* A single source of truth for all changes.
* good for small projects and temporary trials.

#### Cons:
* Can become difficult to manage as it grow.
* Can be challenging to separate concerns.
* if you have the access to the repo you have acces to everything.


### Branches based environment separation
the idea is to create two long live branches dev and prod, where the changes on the dev branch get merged to production,

```
dev-branch
|
├── apps
│   ├── folder1
│   ├── folder2
├── infrastructure
    ├── folder1
    ├── folder2
prod-branch
|
├── apps
│   ├── folder1
│   ├── folder2
├── infrastructure
    ├── folder1
    ├── folder2    
```
#### Pros:

* extra layer pf security only valide changes can be submited to the prod branch. 
* bla bla 
* bla bla 

#### Cons:
* huge mess between application branches and environment branches.
* still challenging to separate concerns.

## Multirepo
A multirepo approach involves creating separate Git repositories for each type of component.
bla bal 
bla 
bla bla 
bla bla 

### Namespace-based MultiRepo

A namespace-based repository approach is based on organizing Git repositories according to namespaces. prod namespace and dev namespace are two different branches, how ever infrastructure and application reseources are still separated using folders.

```
dev-repo
|
├── apps
│   ├── folder1
│   ├── folder2
├── infrastructure
    ├── folder1
    ├── folder2
    
prod-repo
|
├── apps
│   ├── folder1
│   ├── folder2
├── infrastructure
    ├── folder1
    ├── folder2    
```


#### Pros:

* More granular control over each infrastructure component.
* Easier to separate concerns.
* Better isolation and fewer risks of conflicts between changes in different repos.
#### Cons:

* Can be challenging to manage dependencies across multiple repositories.
* More difficult to enforce security policies and collaboration standards.
* May require more management and tools to orchestrate the updates.


### Resource-based MultiRepo 
A Resource-based repository approach is based on organizing Git repositories according to resources. infrastructure and application are two different repositories, how ever prod and app namespaces are still separated using folders.

```
infrastructure-repo
|
├── dev
│   ├── folder1
│   ├── folder2
├── prod
    ├── folder1
    ├── folder2
    
application-repo
|
├── dev
│   ├── folder1
│   ├── folder2
├── prod
    ├── folder1
    ├── folder2    
```
#### Pros:

* easy to separate concerns 
* Collaboration multiple repositories can help you organize your team's work by allowing you to assign specific repositories to specific team members
* can increase security by separating the environments using bracnhes, only valide changes submitted to prod environment.

#### Cons:

* needs to manage changes acrross multiple repositories  
* bla bla bla 
* bla bla bla 

### Context-based MultiRepo (Gimlet) 
at gimlet each repo represent a context `resource@namespace` , were we separate environment into staging and production, and resources into infrastructure and application. 

given that, we will have the following repositories.

* `staging@infrastructure`
* `prod@infrastructure`
* `staging@application`
* `prod@application`

we use the following convetion for naming:
`gitops-namespace-resource`

bla bla ....
```
resource@namespace
|
├── folder1
│   ├── file1
│   ├── file2
├── folder2
    ├── file1
    ├── file2

example:
gitops-staging-infra
|
├── folder1
│   ├── file1
│   ├── file2
├── folder2
    ├── file1
    ├── file2    
```
#### Pros:

* effective way to separate concerns 
* Collaboration multiple repositories can help you organize your team's work by allowing you to assign specific repositories to specific team members
* can increase security by separating the environments using bracnhes, only valide changes submitted to prod environment.
#### Cons:

* needs to sync changes accross multiple repositories  
* bla bla bla 
* bla bla bla 

## Key considerations

In conclusion, the structure of your git repository can greatly impact the development and deployment process of your project.

By carefully planning and organizing your repository structure, you can improve collaboration, maintainability, and scalability of your codebase. Some key considerations to keep in mind when structuring your repository include your
- project's size and complexity,
- the nature of your development team,
- and the tools and workflows that you use.

By following best practices and taking the time to design a thoughtful repository structure, you can set yourself up for success and make it easier to maintain and evolve your project over time.

Remember that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to gitops repository structuring, and that it's important to experiment and iterate as you go to find the structure that works best for your team and your project's goals.
