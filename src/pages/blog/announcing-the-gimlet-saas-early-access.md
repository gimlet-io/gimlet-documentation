We have something really exciting to share with you: Gimlet is going SaaS. In other words, you will be able to use Gimlet's unparalleled Kubernetes deploy experience with even fewer clicks than before.

By signing up to our hosted version and authenticating with Github or Gitlab, you can start deploying your containerized applications to any Kubernetes cluster.

## Kubernetes is the standard in application deployment

Kubernetes is the standard in application deployment, but the state of the empire is that Kubernetes is not for direct consumption. Even though dev teams are longing for the standardized experience, they are not empowered to use it efficiently.

On the two extremes there are the vertically indegrated clouds with a PaaS experience, and platform engineering efforts to build an internal dev platform out of open-source tools. The problem with PaaS is that it works like magic that often falls short when you need to extend it; platform engineering efforts on the other hand are highly customizable but takes forever to build them. A costly effort in the current economic situation.

Gimlet is coming to this landscape with a very specific vision: we wanted to build a gitops based developer platform on top of the de-facto standards of the industry, FluxCD and Helm. To give developers and small devops teams tooling that much larger platform teams would build.

So if you need to deploy on Kubernetes, but not sure how to put things together, we got you covered.

## Today we are announcing our new SaaS Early Access program

We are looking for early access partners: developers, dev teams and DevOps professionals who need to deploy on Kubernetes but don't feel empowered today.

We are a couple of months away from launching our SaaS platform and during this period you would get access to the platform and our engineering team, while helping us with your feedback to be ready for our launch.

[By signing up](https://forms.reform.app/p5JfBA/early-access/nbZ6Go) you will be able to get started for free, and stay free forever as we are announcing our always free plan: 

You will be able to deploy a single service to Kubernetes for free forever. Whether you use that to automate your blog or test-drive Gimlet, it is up to you.

## Gimlet plays well with your choices

Plays well with your CI.
You can keep organizing your CI workflows as you desire, and call Gimlet's API whenever you need to perform a gitops operation.


Bring your own cluster.

Or namespace. Gimlet is not magic hosting.
Gimlet only interacts with git and the gitops paradigm allows it to manage your applications but remain decoupled from your cloud setup.
If you can launch a managed Kubernetes cluster, or have a dedicated namespace, you are good to go. Heck, Gimlet works even with Minikube, k3s or kind.




why saas?

we think that even though we put good work into the installer it is still too much friction
gimlet was made to be clickops, just like netlify, signup find your repo few clicks of deployment config and you are able to deploy
it best shines in a saas version

plus it gives us revenue

open source monetization
