First of all, we’re incredibly sad to see so many amazing professionals finding themselves in an uncertain situation at the worst time of the year for being let go. We encourage the community to help each other out in this situation and let each other know about possible opportunities for Weaveworks' teammates.

We were shocked to overhear the chatter about Weaveworks going out of business early January. As you can see, we’re listed as **[vendors](https://fluxcd.io/ecosystem/)** of the Flux ecosystem on the project’s website. It’s a critical matter to us what happens with the technology at the core of our stack.

We can’t tell for sure what happened, but based on rumors within the community, Weaveworks was on the verge of acquisition but talks never came to fruition.

## What To Expect

Weaveworks built its core business around Kubernetes. Contrary to all the criticism, Kubernetes is dominating the container orchestration field at an increasing trend. How Weaveworks weren’t able to catch a grip with an essentially de facto technology at their hands is an interesting discussion which we can’t determine as outsiders.

It’s fair to expect FluxCD, a graduated CNCF project to survive, but the coming months will bring uncertainty to the project.

It’s unknown yet how the maintainers will react, and hard to assess from an outside point of view how reliant the development of the tool was exclusively on Weaveworks employees. Because industry giants, such as Azure, GitLab and AWS utilize Flux as the preferred gitops solution, it shouldn’t be considered as a pipedream that certain players might take measures to maintain the tool.

It’ll all boil down to whether the giants are willing to stick with Flux for the sake of taking over maintenance, or whether they adopt other solutions, such as Argo CD. Or something completely new emerges.

A recent development of the situation is that the core maintainer of Flux, Stefan Prodan was hired by **[ControlPlane](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7155990780556320768/)**. This is really good news for the project, we like the company and the decision in general.

## What We’ll Do

While business decisions behind FluxCD’s future impact us, we’re taking a moderately confident stance while we gather information about the situation.

For the past couple of months we have been working on [Capacitor](https://github.com/gimlet-io/capacitor), a general purpose UI for Flux. We are preparing to launch the tool as a sign of commitment to the Flux ecosystem.

The end of all considerations is to serve client needs and we are here to serve companies who are committed to gitops.

At the end of the day, most businesses who find value in gitops don’t really care how it happens as long as their needs are met, but some friction is expected until the dust settles. As a small team developing a gitops platform, that’s the mindset we embrace until a new normal emerges.

## What You Can Do

As already mentioned, as an open-source solution, a CNCF graduate project, Flux will stay with us. Until everything is settled, it is probably not the time for rushed decisions.

In the meantime, you may want to follow the Flux community calls or our social handles for analysis of the situation. As a Flux user, you should probably also check out our new general purpose Flux UI: [Capacitor](https://github.com/gimlet-io/capacitor) and make the most out of Flux.
