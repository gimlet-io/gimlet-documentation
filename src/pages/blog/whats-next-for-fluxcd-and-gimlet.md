First of all, we’re incredibly sad to see so many amazing professionals finding themselves in an uncertain situation at the worst time of the year of being let go. We encourage the community to help each other out in this situation and let each other know in case they see an opportunity fit for Weaveworks’ former teammates.

We were shocked to overhear the chatter about Weaveworks going out of business in early January. As you can see, we’re listed as **[vendors](https://fluxcd.io/ecosystem/)** of the Flux ecosystem on the project’s website. It’s a critical matter to us what happens with the technology at the core of our stack.

We can’t tell for sure what happened, but based on rumors within the community, Weaveworks was on the verge of acquisition but talks never came to fruition.

## What To Expect

Weaveworks built its core business around Kubernetes. Contrary to all the criticism, Kubernetes is dominating the container orchestration field at an increasing trend. How Weaveworks weren’t able to catch a grip with an essentially de facto technology at their hands is an interesting discussion which we can’t determine as outsiders.

It’s fair to expect FluxCD, a graduated CNCF project to survive, at least for a little while. It’s unknown yet how the maintainers will react, and hard to assess from an outside point of view how reliant the development of the tool was exclusively on Weaveworks employees. Because industry giants, such as Azure, GitLab and AWS utilize Flux as the preferred GitOps solution, it shouldn’t be considered as a pipedream that certain players might take measures to maintain the CD tool.

It’ll all boil down to whether the giants are willing to stick with Flux for the sake of taking over maintenance, or whether they adopt other solutions, such as Argo CD. Or something completely new emerges.

A recent development of the situation is that the core maintainer of Flux, Stefan Prodan was hired by **[ControlPlane](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7155990780556320768/)**. Really good move, we like the company and the decision in general.

## What We’ll Do

While business decisions behind Flux CD’s future impact us, we’re taking our time gathering information about the situation.

For the past couple of months we’ve been working on Capacitor, a general purpose UI for Flux. So we were as blindsided by the situation as anyone else.

The end of all considerations is to serve client needs, and most businesses who find value in GitOps solutions don’t really care how it happens as long as their needs are met. Some adjustments might come with friction, but at the end of the day, when things work everybody’s happy.

While we’re sorry for the people impacted by the end of Weaveworks, and we’re sad that Weaveworks’ story came to a conclusion, we’re sure we’ll find a way to keep our current users happy with Flux.

As a small team developing a GitOps platform, that’s the mindset we embrace until the ecosystem reacts, see where the chips fall and take the next step according to the changes. Because as much as we love Flux, we can’t live or die by a single technology’s fate.

## What You Can Do

As already mentioned, as an open-source solution, a CNCF graduate project, Flux will stay with us. Until everything is settled, it’s probably worth checking out other GitOps tools, and for one, our users recommend Gimlet for various reasons, including lowering the barrier to entry for Kubernetes and our documentation. And also give Capacitor a look on GitHub if you’re still using Flux.
