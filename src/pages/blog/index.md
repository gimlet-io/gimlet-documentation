{% post name="Announcing the Gimlet SaaS Early Access" image="saas-early-access.png" link="/blog/announcing-the-gimlet-saas-early-access" date="2022-11-01" %}
We have something really exciting to share with you: Gimlet is going SaaS. In other words, you will be able to use Gimlet's unparalleled Kubernetes deploy experience with even fewer clicks than before.

{% post name="Three problems with GitOps as deployment history, and how we overcome them" image="three-problems-with-gitops.png" link="/blog/three-problems-with-gitops-as-deployment-history-and-how-we-overcome-them" date="2022-11-01" %}
One often mentioned property of gitops is that it gives you a deployment history by nature. As you keep updating your desired deployment state in git, it builds up to a trail of changes that you can use to tell what version was deployed at a given time.

Our finding is that this git history is too sparse and noisy at the same time to be used for anything practical without tooling.

In this blog post we describe three problems we experienced once we adopted gitops and Flux CD, and what measures we implemented in Gimlet to overcome them. You may face similar issues in your own gitops platform implementation and this blog post can give you ideas about how to solve them.

{% post name="How Flux broke the CI/CD feedback loop, and how we pieced it back together" image="gitops-broke-cicd.jpg" link="/blog/how-flux-broke-the-cicd-feedback-loop-and-how-we-pieced-it-back-together" date="2022-10-20" %}
A green build used to mean a successful deploy. But then gitops came and broke this heuristic.

The Kyverno policy engine just arrived in Gimlet Stack. Let's see how you can be certain that none of the containers run as root in your Kubernetes cluster.

{% post name="Gimlet Dashboard strategy" image="old-gimlet-ui.png" link="/blog/gimlet-dashboard-strategy" date="2021-05-03" %}
Gimlet Dashboard - or Gimlet Dash in short - is going to be Gimlet's UI component. It tackles multiple purposes, and this document is here to elaborate on that.

See how you can mirror complete environments with gitops and rewrite host names with Kyverno's mutating admission controllers.

 Gimlet was made to be modular. It meets you where you are and helps you to be better off with Kubernetes. 
    This post collects six avenues to adopt Gimlet.

Today, I am thrilled to announce GimletD, the gitops release manager component of Gimlet.

See what GimletD brings to the gitops ecosystem.

> Transporting goods via freight rail networks and container ships is often the most efficient and cost-effective manner of shipping.
>
> However, when goods arrive at a high-capacity freight station or port, they must then be transported to their final destination. This last leg of the supply chain is often less efficient, comprising up to 41% of the total cost to move goods.

Something similar we see with Kubernetes projects.
