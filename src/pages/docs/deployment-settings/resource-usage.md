**You can configure resource usage definitions for requests and limitations.**

You can specify resource requests and limits as you can see in the **Resources** settings of deployments.

To be able to change resource settings, you have to deploy the application first, then click the **Write configuration to Git** button.

You'll be directed to the deployment's status screen, where you need to look for the (...) or meatballs menu, then click the **Edit** button.

Once you're in the settings, click the **Resources** tab, where the following options will be listed.

## Requests

You can configure CPU and Memory requests. Requests are used by Kubernetes for workload placement. The more accurately you set the usual required resource amounts, the better utilized - thus cheaper - your cluster will be.

## Limits

The CPU and Memory limits allocated on the node for your app. It's the maximum resource demand, and its purpose is to prevent your app from consuming more resources than intended.

Your CPU limit will throttle the CPU to the specified limit. Example:

- CPU limit specified at 200m means that 20% consumption of 1 CPU core will be the limit, as 1000m = 1 CPU core.

Your Memory limit will be the cap where your application will be restarted.

## Ignore Limits

You can use this toggle to ignore the limits settings described the way above.
