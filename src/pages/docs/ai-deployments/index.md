## Advanced Deployments

Some projects have certain technical requirements, such as CUDA capable GPUs or creating a Dockerfile. These are the following:

- **[vLLM](/docs/tutorials/ai-deployments/vllm-deployment-tutorial)**: Requires Nvidia GPUs with CUDA.
- **[Hugging Face Model Deployments](/docs/tutorials/ai-deployments/hugging-face-model-deployment-tutorial)**: Requires creating a Dockerfile from scratch in most cases. In many cases, CUDA GPUs are required, as well.
