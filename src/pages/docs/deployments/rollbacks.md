  When something goes wrong, you can use rollbacks in Gimlet to previous versions of your application.

**When something goes wrong with your application, you can revert changes to one of your recent functional versions.**

You can do this by navigating to the service card of your deployed application. After clicking **Repositories** on top, then the deployed application's card, you should see something similar to this:

![Deployment service card in Gimlet where rollbacks are available](/docs/screenshots/rollbacks/gimlet-io-rollbacks-01.png)

Open deploy history by clicking on the timeline at the bottom of the service card.

![Deployment history where you can select which version you'd like to restore by rolling back to it.](/docs/screenshots/rollbacks/gimlet-io-rollbacks-deployment-history.png)

You can roll back to the listed versions with the **Rollback to this version** button, as you can see in the screenshot above.
