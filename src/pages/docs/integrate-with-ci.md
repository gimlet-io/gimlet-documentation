## Prereq
We build on the setting dns, enabling https tutorial

(alternatively this is a standalone tutorial and we use port-forward to access Gimlet and ngrok)

## Step
- we use a forked repo with github actions
  - Using a Dockerfile
  - Using a CI script

- we introduce the gimlet plugin
- we not use the magic deploy, but artifact deploy

## End result
- we use portforward to access the app
