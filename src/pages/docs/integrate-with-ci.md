## Prereq
This is a standalone tutorial and we use port-forward to access Gimlet and ngrok
(We could build on the setting dns, enabling https tutorial, but devs don't have a DNS
we mention that if you completed the dns/https tutorial, you can use the real host name)

## Step
- we use a forked repo with github actions
  - Using a Dockerfile
  - Using a CI script

- we introduce the gimlet plugin
- we not use the magic deploy, but artifact deploy

## End result
- we use portforward to access the app
