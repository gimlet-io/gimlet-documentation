  See what Gimlet does and how it fits your workflow.

Gimlet is a deployment tool built on Kubernetes to make the deploy, preview and rollback workflows accessible to everyone.

## Vision

Kubernetes is percieved to have a high learning curve, complex machinery and only used by large companies for immense scale.

In practice, Kubernetes is a 10 year old technology that is silently used by companies with as little as 10 developers with great success.

Familiarity with Kubernetes is widespread, tooling on the other hand is still built in-house. Gimlet is built to remove the tooling need from the common workflows.

> To keep simple things simple, and complex things possible.

## Workflows

### Like with Vercel or Netlify

commits show up
docker image build options
automate deploys
automate previews

### Or integrate Gimlet to your CI workflows

or if you have CI based processes, integrate it with
keep docker build at CI
benefit from rollback tooling and ad-hoc deploys

## Clusters

cloud gives you 7 days
bring your own hardware
cluster config
upgrade stream
cheap clusters like civo

## Guides you in your path to master Kubernetes

app debug
cluster things
deploy settings

## Gitops

flux
observe flux

## Extend Gimlet to your needs
